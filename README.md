# Property Archive

Property Archive is a web-based platform designed to help homeowners document and organize personal property *before* a natural disaster occurs, making insurance claims easier and less stressful afterward.

## Problem
After natural disasters, many homeowners struggle with insurance claims because they lack documentation of their belongings. Recreating this information after loss is overwhelming and often incomplete.

## Goal
Provide a simple, secure way for users to document belongings when life is calm, so they are prepared when it is not.

## Current Status
Project is in the planning and design phase.

## Planned Features

- Categorization and search
- Exportable reports for insurance claims

## Technologies
To be determined during the planning phase.
